## 🚀 What I build

I specialize in native Apple apps using modern Swift (Swift 6 + SwiftUI), with a strong focus on:

- Clean Architecture & MVVM
- Unidirectional data flow
- Async/Await & Actors (strict concurrency)
- SwiftData persistence
- Audio streaming & CarPlay
- End-to-end delivery (Xcode Cloud, TestFlight)

Current projects:

- **Zona Salsa Radio** — SwiftUI streaming app with CarPlay support  
- **Bachata Trainer** — rhythm training app using haptics & audio feedback
